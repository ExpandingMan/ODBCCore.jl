This is a minimal wrapper for the ODBC library for Julia.  This is based on [ODBC.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDB/ODBC.jl), in which core ODBC functions aren't
really wrapped before being used in more advanced functions.  This project is pretty speculative right now, and I have no idea if I'll follow it through.
